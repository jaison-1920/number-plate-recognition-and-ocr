# Vehicle Number Plate Detection and OCR
This project focuses on real-time detection of vehicle number plates using a webcam and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract essential information. It offers the following key features:

Live Image Capture: The application captures images from a webcam when the 's' key on the keyboard is pressed, allowing for real-time number plate detection.

Region of Interest Extraction: It uses a Haar Cascade model to identify and extract the number plates from the captured images, enabling targeted analysis.

Image Saving: You have the option to save the extracted region of interest (ROI) images for future reference.

OCR Processing: The project uses OCR to extract the vehicle's number, registration state, and the time of capture from the extracted ROI.

Data Logging: The extracted data, including the number plate, registration state, and capture time, is saved to a CSV file for organized record-keeping.

This project leverages computer vision techniques to provide a practical and real-time solution for vehicle number plate detection and information extraction.
